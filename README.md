# Machine-Learning

In this project, I leverage machine learning techniques to develop classifiers capable of accurately
identifying patients with candidemia based on a comprehensive set of features. My analysis includes three
distinct classifiers which are k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Naïve Bayes and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
Each classifier brings unique strengths and approaches to the task, from the simplicity and interpretability of
kNN to the probabilistic nature of Naïve Bayes and the complex non-linear relationships captured by MLP.


Dataset Description
The dataset I used in the project are real-world data of patients diagnosed with candidemia. Each patient is
described by 77 features (F1 – F77) and a binary target variable (“Outcome”), indicating whether the patient
has candidemia (1) or not (0). The first 17 features are numerical features and the rest is Boolean features.
Different pre-processing techniques would be conducted to each type of the features.
